# Introduction
</div>

Large volumes and a variety of data are generated by today's businesses in the form of e-documents, scanned images, emails, text messages and responses, user reviews, and so on. All of this is going to grow tremendously when they go digital. Almost 80\% of the data created is semi-structured or unstructured, and the wide variety of document kinds and formats makes automation and analysis difficult. For enterprises to analyze and derive insights from thousands of documents, it would require huge manual effort and would be time-consuming.

**SPAR10** is an intelligent AI-driven product which helps businesses automate the process of capturing and analyzing structured and unstructured text data through AI/ML. It is developed as a web application, using a variety of Linguistic and Machine Learning models along with Natural Language Processing to solve problems associated with text data. It applies different algorithms for each business problem.
