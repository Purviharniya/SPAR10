I can’t say enough about these headphones. They’re excellent for the gym! They don’t fall off and aren’t uncomfortable after a while. The sound is amazing and the controls are easy to use without needing your phone picked up. They don’t hold moisture or water and I just wipe them off after my workout. Very satisfied with this purchase, they come in a sturdy zip-up case and with their own charging cable. The charge lasts a decent amount of time obviously depending on your usage but is well worth the buy! And the color is absolutely adorable!
